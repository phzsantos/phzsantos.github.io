## Disclaimer

Well, it actually isn't related to i3 WM, i3 WM is just a window manager, it means it just adjust windows on your screen and that's it. However, sometimes you want to connect some bluetooth devices on your PC and for that you certainly don't want to go through a lot of commands on your shell, so just use blueman

## 1 - Install blueman

```shell
sudo dnf install blueman
```

## 2 - Now you can manage your bluetooth devies :)
