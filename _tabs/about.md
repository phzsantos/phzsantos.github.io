# Who I am

Hi! My name's Paulo Henrique, I'm a software developer, inveterate gamer and sometimes a teacher.

## My history with technology

Back then when I was 3 years old, I started to play games on my father's PC, since that, I'm always nearby technology. I did my first VM when I was 12 years old. I installed my first linux distribution when I was 13 years old. But I only started to study development in 2019, when I was 17. I started with Python. 1 year later, I flew out high school and got a work as software developer and system support with a programing language called LSP (Linguagem Senior de programacao). This language is a backend programing language of ERP called *Sapiens*. I worked with this for a year and 4 months. in background I was learning programing logic, a little bit of C, C++, python. Today I still learning C. I stoped learning C++ and python. I did somethings web development (HTM, CSS and JS) but I always come back to C. I'm on the way to College. So I'm working on things that can help me there. I can say that I'm a little bit "lost" in this way 'cause I started a lot of things and only finished programming logic. I need to learn WEB, I need to finish C. I need to start Java and so on.... this blog is a tool to help me learn and share these things. Right I think that's it. See ya.
